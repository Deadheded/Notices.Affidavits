How should I send my Notice?

All Affidavits should be printed on legal sized paper (8.5' x 14') but it is not absolute for Notices.  Most of these are legal size (8 x 14) usless they say letter size 
in the title.  If you don't have legal size paper then please use leter size.  Your name and address at the top and your name on the line in the first paragraph after 
“I”

Autograph the last page and date it. 

You should mail it to your Sheriff directly.  If for what every reason you can not do this, we will soon have an address you can send them in to and we will send them to 
the proper offices.

Idealy Notices should be sent via certified mail.  There are a few reasons why you may not do this.  One is the address, if it is a Post Office Box you will need to send 
First Class or ask the clerk if there is any deliveray conformation options.  Certified mail can be a bit costly so you may also ask about priority signature mail. 

If you can only send certified or priority signature to one of the 3 or 7 addresses please make that address your County Sheriff, the other address will be getting
plenty of certified copies so a simple stamped envelope to them will have the impact of large numbers. 

Please remember the spirit of this Notice.  We have empowered our Sheriffs with special authority above all others, they are one of us, part of our community, and here 
for our benefit.  We want our Sheriffs to know that as long as they are adhearing to their oath of office and protecting the People, We the People will stand in support 
of them and help protect them from the emence political pressurs they are offten put under.

Although all of us can probably tells stories of corrupt law enforcement, the majority of our Sheriffs are here for the People.  To lend creadence to this I will leave 
you with a quote from our Florida's Sheriff's Association.  

“NOVEMBER 18, 2021
The Florida Sheriffs Association today released the following statement from FSA President and Levy County Sheriff Bobby McCallum:

“Nothing is more important than individual liberties and safety, and the Florida Sheriffs Association, like Governor DeSantis, is committed to protecting both. The 
Sheriffs of Florida will not participate in the federal government's effort to intimidate parents into silence. We are deeply troubled to hear allegations that the FBI 
is weaponizing its Counterterrorism Division to investigate parents who care about their children's education. Concerned parents are not domestic terrorists. We 
wholeheartedly oppose any infringement on anyone's first amendment rights. Florida's Sheriffs are the best in the nation, and we will take all appropriate action to 
protect everyone in Florida, including elected officials.” “
